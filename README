To instal this API

Before running this API you must create a .env file in the project root.
Then in this file you should create:
SECRET = "String"
SALT = "String"
DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://(POSTGRES_USER):(POSTGRES_PASSWORD)@localhost:5432/pgdb?schema=public" (I used PostgresDB and PrismaORM)

And finally make the migration
