To instal this API

--- npm ci

Before running this API you must create a .env file in the project root.
Then in this file you should create:
SECRET = " String"
SALT = ''Number"
DATABASE_URL = "String" (I used PostgresDB and PrismaORM)

And finally make the migration

To run this API

--- npm run dev
